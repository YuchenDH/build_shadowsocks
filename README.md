# build_shadowsocks
This script will install shadowsocks server on most linux platforms. Also modifies iptables to open a corresponding port.
=======
Instructions:
Please use root privillege or sudo to avoid being denied.

Simply modify shadowsocks_sample.json according to your server ip. Then execute:

./build_shadowsocks.sh

If it is not runnable, try execute

sudo chmod +x build_shadowsocks.sh

The script will ask you to input your server port again. Please make sure it is the SAME with what you input in shadowsocks_sample.json

The script will directly copy from shadowsocks_sample.json. DO NOT RENAME IT.

Feel free to leave any comment or issue.
